# Neural Networking

This repository contains the source code of a neural network project. ðŸ”¥

## Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment you need to have `python` installed.
To check if you have Python, you need to type `python --version`. This command will show the version of Python installed.

***Create A Virtual Environment:*** You need to type `python -m venv .venv`. You can replace the **.venv** part, but **.venv** is default for programmers.

***Activate the Virtual Environment:*** You need to type `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows, `./.venv/bin/activate` on Linux or Mac. You need to replace the **.venv** part with the name of your virtual environment name that you created on last part.

## Installing

***Install the Requirements:*** Inside of your virtual environment, type `pip install -r requirements`. That should install the requirements.

## Running

***Running:*** Inside of your virtural enviroment, type `venv\Scripts\python.exe src\main.py` on Windows, `venv/bin/python.exe src/main.py` on Linux or Mac for running this project.
You can change `main.py` part to any python file in that directory like `version.py`.
